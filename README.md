 Incise is an early prototype of an application that combines aiming and cognitive training. 

## Overview

Two of my cousins are keen video game players (mostly FPS and action-RPG). One day we had a discussion about gaming and one of them asked me if I had any suggestions for him to become better during gameplay. I asked him if he had something specific in mind and he described a situtation in which he erroneously killed members of him team instead of enemies. His reasoning was that "I wanted to be fast to prevent enemies from killing me first". This reminded me of an old and well-established cognitive task, called GO/NO-GO. In this task, people have to respond to some kind of stimuli (e.g. press a button when the green dot is present-"GO") and withold their responses to some other stimuli (e.g. not pressing a button when the red dot is present-"NO GO"). For that reason, I came up with an idea for an application that combines aiming (an essential skill for FPS gamers) with training scenarios in which the users have to respond or inhibit their response (GO/NO-GO) based on specific criteria. 

## Description

This is an interactive application in which spheres of different colors (red and green) are presented one-by-one in random spatial locations. The goal of the user is to shoot the green spheres (GO condition) as fast as possible while avoid shooting the red spheres (NO-GO condition). The application has a customized number of repetitions and has a certain level of difficulty, given there are more GO than NO-GO trials (when GO trials repeat, users tend to be faster, which makes them more prone to errors when a NO-GO trial suddenly appears).

## Development Specifications - Future Development Plan

The application was developed using `Unity 2020.3.23f1`. The ultimate goal is to create a suite of interactive games that combine aiming and cognitive training (more tasks, better analytics, etc.). VR support is also expected at some point.
